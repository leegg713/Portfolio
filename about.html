    <p>About Section that will have a lot of good stuff on why I should get hired as a web developer.Will need to update
        this with my actual info when I start applying.

        Welcome to my digital playground! I'm [Your Name], a passionate web developer with a love for turning ideas into
        interactive and visually stunning websites. With a keen eye for design and a knack for problem-solving, I strive
        to
        create seamless and engaging user experiences.

        What I Do:

        As a web developer, my skill set spans both front-end and back-end technologies. From crafting pixel-perfect
        user
        interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building robust server-side applications with Node.js and Express,
        I
        am dedicated to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions.

        Technologies I Love:

        Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js
        Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
        Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
        Version Control: Git, GitHub
        Tools: VS Code, Webpack, npm
        My Approach:

        I believe in the power of clean code and user-centric design. Every line of code I write is a step towards
        creating
        an immersive and enjoyable digital experience. I'm always up for a challenge, whether it's optimizing
        performance,
        implementing new features, or diving into the latest web technologies
